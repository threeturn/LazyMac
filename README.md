## But i'm using X and I don't see it!

A lot of features are missing, and will be added in the future. Feel free contibute. 

## You are using Chef, I want to use X

Cool, do it! I like Chef, it's simple and flexible for this type of use cases.

## X is not working as expected. 

Please create an issue in github. I will do my best to fix it.

## Where are the inspec tests.

ENOTIME, and I'm a bit lazy, but I will add it eventually. Bare with me.
